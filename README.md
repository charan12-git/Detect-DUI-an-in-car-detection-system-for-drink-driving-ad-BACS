# Detect-DUI-an-in-car-detection-system-for-drink-driving-ad-BACS


<h2>Objective:</h2>
<p>As one of the biggest contributors to road accidents and fatalities, drink driving is worthy of significant research attention. However, most existing systems on detecting or preventing drink driving either require special hardware or require much effort from the user, making these systems inapplicable to continuous drink driving monitoring in a real driving environment. In this paper, we present DetectDUI, a contactless, non-invasive, real-time system that yields a relatively highly accurate drink driving monitoring by combining  vital signs (heart rate and respiration rate) extracted from in-car WiFi system and driverâ€™s psychomotor coordination through steering wheel operations. The framework consists of a series of signal processing algorithms for extracting clean and informative vital signs and psychomotor coordination, and integrate the two data streams using a self-attention convolutional neural network (i.e., C-Attention). In safe laboratory experiments with 15 participants, DetectDUI achieves drink driving detection accuracy of 96.6% and BAC predictions with an average mean error of 2 _ 5mg/dl. These promising results provide a highly encouraging case for continued development.
